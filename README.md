# Helper Scripts

This repository contains scripts to help keep our labs and repos organized, as well as help with content creation.

## `rename.py`

Renames lab files by changing their first double-digit to the double-digit of their containing folder. Takes away some of the headache of moving labs between sections.

**Possible result**:

## `replace_links.py`

Replaces all occurrences of Markdown links in `.md` files in the current folder with HTML links that open up in a new tab. If you create your content in a Markdown editor and you use normal MD links, run this script before adding your content to the platform.

E.g.:

```md
[Example](http://www.example.com)
```

turns into:

```html
<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Example</a>
```

The rest of your content remains unchanged.

## `add_toc.py`

**ATTENTION**: Unfortunately, Moodle renders Markdown without adding IDs, therefore the links created with this script don't link anywhere ðŸ˜”. It works on other Markdown rendering engines and you can use it e.g. for GitHub, or really most anything else. If you need to create a TOC for the CodingNomads Learning Platform, please check out the process described in `add_html_toc.py` below.

This script allows you to add a clickable TOC to the top of your Markdown documents. It requires the external package called `md-toc`. You can install it via the included `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt`.

If you execute the script inside of the top-level folder of your course content, it will add a linked TOC to the top of each file that contains the following **HTML comment**:

```html
<!--TOC-->
```

It doesn't matter where it appears, but it needs to be part of your file for the script to pick it up, analyze the headings, and create the TOC.

**Note:** The HTML comment does _not_ get removed and the script does _not_ check whether a TOC already exists. If you run it multiple times you will get multiple TOC. Therefore, I suggest to run the script _once_ at the _end_ of your content creation workflow before adding the content online.

## `add_html_toc.py`

This script creates a rendered copy of your Markdown files in HTML _and_ adds a clickable TOC to the document, wherever the indicator specifies. It requires the external package called `markdown`. You can install it via the included `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt`.

If you execute the script inside of the top-level folder of your course content, it will add a linked TOC to each file that contains the following **TOC indicator**:

```markdown
[TOC]
```

The TOC will get included wherever the indicator appears. It needs to be present in your file for the script to pick it up, analyze the headings, create the TOC, and create the duplicate file that has been rendered to HTML.

This script does _not_ change your original Markdown file, but opts to create a rendered _copy_ in HTML. Since Moodle doesn't render Markdown headers with an `id` attribute in their native .md to .html converter, you will **need to add the HTML version** if you want a clickable TOC on the learning platform.

**Note**: There are some issues with this still, e.g. it seems that fenced code blocks get rendered weirdly when inputted as HTML instead of Markdown, so use at your own risk and keep in mind you might need to do some manual editing.
